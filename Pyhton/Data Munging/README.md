## Data cleaning checklist
* Save original data
* Identify missing data
* Identify placeholder data (e.g. 0's for NA's)
* Identify outliers
* Check for overall plausibility and errors (e.g., typos, unreasonable ranges)
* Identify highly correlated variables
* Identify variables with (nearly) no variance
* Identify variables with strange names or values
* Check variable classes (eg. Characters vs factors)
* Remove/transform some variables (maybe your model does not like categorial variables)
* Rename some variables or values (if not all data is useful)
* Check some overall pattern (statistical/ numerical summaries)
* Possibly center/scale variables
