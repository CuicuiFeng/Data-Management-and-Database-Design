### Four Types of Joins
* There are actually four types of joins supported by the Pandas merge function. Here's how they are described by the documentation:
#### inner: use intersection of keys from both frames (SQL: inner join)
#### outer: use union of keys from both frames (SQL: full outer join)
#### left: use only keys from left frame (SQL: left outer join)
#### right: use only keys from right frame (SQL: right outer join)
